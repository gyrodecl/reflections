Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do
   you need to do it?
A: This creates an empty git repository. This adds an empty .git/ folder
inside your folder to add more metadata.  It can track your changes.Any
files that are currently in the folder are marked as "untracked."

Q:How is the staging area different from the working directory and
the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A:The staging area lets us choose which files we want to commit from the working
directory to the repository.  It allows us to selectively choose which files to commit
and at certain times.  It lets us have more granular control over the commits.
