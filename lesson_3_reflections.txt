Q:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A:A remote repository is useful if you want to backup your files in the cloud.  It's also necessary if you want to
collaborate with other people, either with a small team or a large open source project.

Q:Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A:There might be changes on the remote repo that you don't necessarily
want to include in your local version.  Especially if this is code from someone else,
it would overwrite files that you have saved.
