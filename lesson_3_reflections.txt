Q:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A:A remote repository is useful if you want to backup your files in the cloud.  It's also necessary if you want to
collaborate with other people, either with a small team or a large open source project.

Q:Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A:There might be changes on the remote repo that you don't necessarily
want to include in your local version.  Especially if this is code from someone else,
it would overwrite files that you have saved.

Q:Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

A:A branch is when you want to work locally on an extension of your project.
maybe to add a new feature.  Cloning is GitHubRepo -->Local Machine or
Local Machine --> Local Machine.  It's copying a repository from 1 place to another.
Cloning sets up a remote to the original location where you got the folder from.
Forking is when someone has a GitHub repo and you want to have a version you can work
on, but you don't have access to their account.  So you do fork on Github, which is
GitHubRepo-->Your Own GitHubRepo.  To have that locally, then you'd do do a git clone
of your github repo.  This is now pointing to your forked version on GitHub.
